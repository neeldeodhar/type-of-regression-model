
How to choose the Best regression model: (Article 4)

Article analysis:

  In this article the author focuses on statistical methods used for finding the best regaression model.

The bottomline being lower P values for predictors and higher Adjusted R squared and predicted R squared values,
i.e. lower P values indicate that the terms are statistically significant and higher confidence rate.

It also talks about real world complications that a selected model can have. 
For example, as per the author
1) the results of the variables can be also be biased by significant variables NOT included or omitted i.e. the results are not just based on what's included.
2) Testing lot of models can have variables that are co-related by chance (co-incidence) but not by significance.


Further the author has given recommendations on finding the best regression 
According to the author of the article
a) Theory: "Building on results of others makes it easier to collect right data and choose regression model and theoritical considerations should not be ignored based only on statistical methods.
b) complexity: simpler models product more precise predictions.
c) residual Plots: "The simplest model that produces random residuals is a good candidate for being a relatively precise and unbiased model".





My feedback:
    The article doesn't take into consideration the "ease to understand or the "interpretability" towards choosing the right model.
    Secondly the article doesn't take into consideration the pros and cons of all different regression models 
    Also, the type of dataset (volume or quality) is not taken into consideration. For example for a larger dataset KNN regressor model is more suited or for smaller dataset Decision Tree modeis more suited.
